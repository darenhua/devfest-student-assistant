Moderated by <a href=\"https://harriman.columbia.edu/person/gail-archer/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Gail Archer</strong></a>.</p>\n<p>Why are artists increasingly aligning with far-right movements in Eastern Europe and beyond? This talk examines the social foundations of the emerging coalition between far-right regimes and cultural producers, challenging conventional narratives about progressive art and repressive politics. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork with the Hungarian Academy of Arts&mdash;a cultural flagship institution of Viktor Orb&aacute;n's Hungary&mdash;this presentation offers a political-economic analysis of contemporary culture wars. The talk reveals how the long downturn of US global hegemony, combined with the neoliberal restructuring of cultural markets, has created conditions for artists to become willing participants in national-protectionist and imperial projects. Besides mapping the emergence of this unexpected coalition, the talk also explores how these alliances succeed through institutional mechanisms&mdash;from patronage systems to the social penetration of local cultural production&mdash;and why previous liberal resistance movements have failed. Ultimately, this talk aims to offer takeaways beyond the case of Hungary by providing a novel understanding of culture wars as the rapid transformation of the art-patronage relation amid new economic arrangements and imperial ambitions.</p>\n<p><em>Please email disability@columbia.edu to request disability accommodations.

    "description": "<p>Presentation by Craig Martin.</p>\n<p><strong>Paleogeography of the southern Eurasian margin in the lead-up to the India-Eurasia collision</strong></p>\n<p>At the onset of the India-Eurasia collision the Eurasian margin was a complex system with extended back-arc basins and significant tracts of oceanic crust between the converging volcanic arc(s) and continental plates. Constraining the time of when Indian and Eurasian continental lithosphere began to accommodate India-Eurasia convergence is crucial to understand how continental plates behave during orogenesis. I will present field mapping, U/Pb zircon ages, and (U-Th)/He zircon cooling ages that constrain the tectonostratigraphic and structural development of the Shyok suture zone, which separates the Kohistan-Ladakh arc from the Karakoram terrane in north-western India and Pakistan. Our results show that the Shyok suture comprises a Jurassic fore-arc ophiolite overlain by Eurasia-derived sedimentary strata which accumulated in a Cretaceous back-arc basin that was under extension until the Paleocene onset of India-Eurasia collision. Closure of this back-arc basin post-dates the formation of the Indus suture zone between the Kohistan-Ladakh arc and India by as much as 15-20 million years. This suggests that before the Eocene, a significant portion of India-Eurasia convergence was accommodated by subduction rather than crustal thickening.</p>",

Long cast as a peripheral zone of great power competition within the spheres of influence of Russia and China, the region is increasingly asserting itself as an autonomous actor balancing relationships with Russia, China, the United States, the European Union, Turkey, India, and the Gulf states through multivector diplomacy. This lecture explores how Central Asian governments and publics are leveraging shifting global alignments, critical mineral wealth, and emerging transit corridors to gain leverage and resist dependency. Rather than being pawns on a chessboard, Central Asian societies are challenging the influence of external powers through protests, critical discourses and armed attacks. External powers are forced to adapt their approach to the region as a result of this backlash.</p>\n<p>In an era defined by contested global orders and technological competition, Central Asia has the potential to be not just a bridge between East and West, but a key set of actors asserting themselves in a multipolar world.</p>\n<p><em>Please email disability@columbia.edu to request disability accommodations.

Moderated by <a href=\"https://harriman.columbia.edu/person/alexandra-birch/\"><strong>Alexandra Birch</strong></a>.</p>\n<p>This event explores the aftermath of war and genocide in 1940s Poland through the lens of the country&rsquo;s classical music scene. Disputing the assumption that the late 1940s was primarily a time of the imposition of communist ideology in musical circles, Pierce explores the myriad forces that led musicians into cooperation with the state, in ways that often replicated prewar discourses and priorities of the musical community. In addition to considering these forces of institutional continuity across the war, he also explores the process of selection and narration of wartime music-making during the late 1940s in ways that erected powerful, long-lasting narratives of aesthetic and musical growth across wartime trauma. The presentation and seminar will be based on his recent book, &quot;Sounds of Survival: Polish Music and the Holocaust&quot; (University of California Press, 2025), a selection of which will be circulated in advance.</p>\n<p><em>Please email disability@columbia.edu to request disability accommodations.

    "description": "<p><strong>Condoms, Withdrawal &amp; Abstinence: Oh My!</strong></p>\n<p>This study examines sexual activity, contraceptive dynamics and unmet need among young women aged 18&ndash;24 in Eswatini, using bi-weekly data collected over one year from a mobile phone survey. Although most participants expressed a strong desire to avoid pregnancy, only one in four used contraception consistently. Findings revealed distinct profiles of women with unmet need for family planning (44%) - more likely to spend time away from home, be in school and be nulliparous - compared to peers with met need. Using hybrid within-between regression models, we found the probability of contraceptive use increased slightly when a woman was more sexually active. Participants who were parous and worked also had higher probability of use. These results offer new insight into the situational nature of contraceptive behavior and suggest that among this population with sporadic sexual activity, unmet need is often brief and preceded by abstinence.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Dr. Abigail (Abba) Greenleaf</strong> is a public health demographer whose research focuses on collecting data in low- and middle-income countries where using cell phones to survey populations is an increasingly viable methodology. In the United States, phone-based surveys have been common since the 1980s. In areas such as Africa, until recently there was not sufficient cell phone ownership to create valid phone-based health estimates, and researchers like Dr. Greenleaf have been assessing the reliability of this increasingly popular approach to data collection. Dr. Greenleaf currently works with ICAP's Population-Based HIV Impact Assessment (PHIA) project. Carried out under the leadership of national ministries of health, PHIA data benchmark a country's progress towards controlling the HIV epidemic.</p>",

    "description": "<p><strong>Join IGP for an Across the Aisle conversation with Thomas H. Lee and Gillian Metzger, moderated by Matthew Waxman.</strong></p>\n<p>Debates over the nature and scope of US presidential power go back to the Constitutional Convention. During the Cold War, concerns about the &ldquo;imperial presidency&rdquo; led to legal, administrative, and normative reforms in the 1970s. In the 1980s&ndash;and again after 9/11&ndash;the debate shifted to whether the presidency had become too weak to manage evolving national security threats, leading proponents of a stronger executive to advance the Constitutional theory of a &ldquo;unitary executive.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>With recent Supreme Court decisions supporting an &ldquo;energetic presidency,&rdquo; and President Donald Trump&rsquo;s re-election in 2024, advocates of a more expansive view of presidential power appear to be winning the contemporary debate. How strong should the American presidency be?</p>\n<p><strong><strong>Panelists:</strong></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><strong>Thomas H.

    "description": "<p><strong>CTLgrads Learning Community: </strong><strong>Embodied Learning: Object-Based Approaches to Inclusivity in the Classroom </strong>(Part 2 of 2)</p>\n<p>How can pedagogical practices respond more fully to differences in access, ability, learning styles, and prior knowledge? This Learning Community invites participants from across disciplines to reflect on such questions by foregrounding the role of objects and the body in learning. We will reflect on how objects can transform pedagogical experiences, and how teaching with objects can cultivate more inclusive classrooms. The first session will address the practical side of our topic: how can teaching with objects enhance discussions within and beyond the classroom? How might instructors frame and prepare lessons centered around the study of objects, regardless of discipline? In the second session, we will address the theoretical dimension of embodied learning. This session will introduce and discuss key theoretical frameworks related to embodiment in cognitive approaches, learning through the body, object-based learning, object theory, and the pedagogies of artefacts. Participants will collectively assess how these theories challenge mind&ndash;body dualisms operating in the classroom, reconceptualize knowledge as situated and material, and inform inclusive pedagogical practices that recognize learning as an embodied, relational, and multisensorial process.</p>\n<p><em>This session is designed and led by Julia Carabatsos and Jazm&iacute;n Novoa Lara, Senior Lead Teaching Fellows at the CTL. </em></p>\n<p><strong><em>Note: this is Part 2 of a two-part</em></strong><a href=\"https://ctl.columbia.edu/graduate-instructors/ctlgrads-learning-communities/\"><strong><em> </em></strong><strong><em>CTLgrads Learning Community</em></strong></a><strong><em>.

This question is central to cancer biology and treatment development. Towards answers, hundreds of thousands of cancer genomes have been sequenced, and signals of positive selection in cancer genomes have implicated hundreds of genes as putative drivers. However, positive selection does not imply cancer causation: positively selected mutations pervade normal aging tissues, even in the absence of cancer. Here, we develop a probabilistic framework to disentangle selection in normal tissue and causation of carcinogenesis. We derive an estimator for mutations&rsquo; effects on cancer risk based on a comparison of cancer and normal tissue genomes, which we apply to the blood, esophagus, and colon. We show mathematically and empirically that stronger cancer-causing mutations are enriched in younger patients, enabling cancer-causing mutations to be identified from patient age distributions. We show moreover that the age-dependence of purported causal mutations in acute myeloid leukemia can be explained largely by normal blood evolution, challenging the long-standing notion that childhood cancers require distinct mutations. Broadly, our framework separates carcinogenesis from normal tissue aging, improving the assessment of cancer risk conferred by mutations.</p>\n<p><strong>Bio: </strong>David Cheek is a Research Associate in Genetics at Harvard Medical School. His education was in mathematics at the universities of Oxford (undergraduate) and Edinburgh (PhD). Now he studies somatic evolution and carcinogenesis through the probabilistic lenses of branching processes.</p>\n<p>If you would like to meet one-on-one (possibly via Zoom) or attend the lunch or dinner with the speaker, please contact the event organizer.</p>",

Hegel&rsquo;s thought, from the nineteenth century to the present, with the aim of developing new critical perspectives and practices for today&rsquo;s times.</p>\n<p>The ambition of this multi-year project is to serve as a catalyst to produce new forms of critique and praxis to address the present political conjuncture.</p>\n<p>New philosophies and practices have so often emerged from a sharp confrontation with past ideas, especially, and curiously, from confrontations with Hegel&rsquo;s paradigm. Whether it was Marx in the nineteenth century turning the Phenomenology of Spirit on its head, or Lenin closely annotating The Science of Logic, or C.L.R. James transforming the dialectic into a tool for decolonization, or Frantz Fanon or Jean-Paul Sartre inverting the master-slave dialectic, or Judith Butler turning subjectivity into desire, so many of the major contributions to critique and praxis in the past two centuries were born from an antagonistic struggle with Hegel&rsquo;s thought.</p>\n<p>From early on with Ludwig Feuerbach and the Young Hegelians, to Alexandre Koj&egrave;ve in the 1930s and his influence on post-war French philosophy but also on Allan Bloom and American conservative thought, or to the Johnson-Forest Tendency within the U.S. workers&rsquo; movement composed of CLR James, Raya Dunayevskaya, and Grace Lee Boggs, the contradictions in Hegel&rsquo;s thought have given birth to some of the most important and impactful political ideas and practices.</p>\n<p>It is time then, once again, to return to Hegel, not to think with him, but rather, as it has so often been more productive, to think against and beyond him. It is time for another round of agonistic confrontations with Hegel&rsquo;s writings&mdash;The Phenomenology of Spirit (1807), The Science of Logic (1812-1816), the Encyclopedia (1817), and the Principles of the Philosophy of Law (1820).</p>\n<p>The multi-year project &ldquo;Inversions of Hegel 13/13&rdquo; will begin during the academic year 2025-2026 with preparatory sessions (informal conversations, small seminars, reading groups, and lectures) that will lay the groundwork for a 13/13 public seminar series on the confrontations with Hegel&rsquo;s writings that have shaped world history. Throughout, the ambition will be to develop a new critical praxis for today.</p>",

Drawing from his new book, Gordon examines the often-invisible processes that shape how music comes into being. The speaker will discuss how listening, experimentation, failure, and tacit knowledge operate before and beyond formalized theory.</p>\n<p><em>The Composer&rsquo;s Blackbox</em> positions itself at the intersection of composition, sound research, and reflective practice. We&rsquo;re asking how composers think <em>with</em> sound rather than merely organize it. Gordon will reflect on how material engagement, technological mediation, and personal listening histories inform creative choices, challenging linear narratives of authorship and mastery.</p>\n<p>Blending analytical insight and performance, this talk invites composers, performers, and listeners to reconsider composition as an evolving, opaque system, one that resists full explanation while remaining deeply responsive to sensation, context, and time.</p>\n<h3>Event Speaker</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gc.cuny.edu/people/theodore-gordon\" target=\"_blank\">Ted Gordon</a>, Assistant Professor of Music at CUNY Graduate Center</p>\n<h3>Event Information</h3>\n<p>Free and open to the public; <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ted-gordon-the-composers-blackbox-registration-1978434582093\" target=\"_blank\">registration</a> required.

Research in this area has traditionally been divided between Eulerian studies of long-term local averages and Lagrangian analyses of individual storms. Here, we bridge these approaches by statistically analyzing thousands of storm tracks. Using a global 84-year storm catalog based on ERA5 data, we examine how Eulerian measures of storm activity, specifically the Eady growth rate, affect the Lagrangian growth of individual storms. We show that increasing baroclinicity generally enhances storm growth, whereas extreme jets suppress it. This non-monotonic behavior arises because strong jets promote rapid intensification while simultaneously limiting growth time, owing to their competing effects on available energy and storm vertical structure.</p>\n<p>Building on these results, we address why Atlantic storms are more intense in winter than Pacific storms, despite the Pacific&rsquo;s stronger jet stream. We identify a second key mechanism: jet orientation. The Pacific&rsquo;s zonally elongated jet causes eastward- and poleward-propagating storms to exit the jet rapidly, whereas the Atlantic&rsquo;s tilted jet aligns with storm trajectories, allowing longer residence times and greater growth. Together, these two mechanisms quantitatively explain the observed contrast in storm activity.</p>\n<p>Finally, we examine the role of climate in storm variability. Using machine learning, we show that climate accounts for only a third of individual storm variability, although it accounts for over 90% of average storm activity. Further statistical analysis indicates that long-term climate trends account for only 0.1% of individual-storm variability, highlighting the challenges of attributing climate change impacts at the individual-storm level.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>In person attendance at this seminar is only open to Columbia University affiliates.</em></p>",
